## CS5379 Parallel Processing

In this lecture, we write a program to add the elements of two arrays.

We begin by examining the code in C++ running on the CPU.

Then, we write the CUDA version of that code to run on the GPU.

We see that taking full advantage of the GPU requires some fine-tuning.

To achieve this, we profile different versions of the code to make it run faster!
